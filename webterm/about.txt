Welcome to my website!

This site provides a virtual shell and is meant to be a command line joke where
you have to use some UNIX commands to get around. 

If you are bored, try the commands clock or matrix or weather or reboot.

I am sorry to slow your hacking instincts. You can however create files on the
web root directory and even view them with the browser by entering the file name 
in the address bar. Use vi or try:

echo "Hello there, my name is Greco." > hello.txt

You can now view the file with cat hello.txt and check its existence with ls -l.

Then delete the file with rm hello.txt.

If you are a Unix/Linux/BSD user, you might be interested in the Unix Toolbox:
